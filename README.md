# SubCycle

An intelligent subscription manager that tells you when to subscribe and when to pause streaming services based on upcoming content you'd actually watch.

## Purpose

SubCycle analyzes your taste preferences and upcoming content across streaming platforms to give you actionable recommendations: keep, pause, or consider each subscription. Stop paying for services with nothing you want to watch.

## TODO

- [x] Phase 1: Foundation (auth, database, UI shell)
- [x] Phase 2: Onboarding (service selection, taste quiz)
- [x] Phase 3: Dashboard (subscription list with actions)
- [x] Phase 4: Content Intelligence (TMDB integration)
- [x] Phase 5: AI Recommendations (Claude-powered advice)
- [x] Phase 6: Reminders & Polish (25/25 tasks complete)
