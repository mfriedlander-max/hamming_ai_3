# SubCycle

An intelligent subscription manager that tells you when to subscribe and when to pause streaming services based on upcoming content you'd actually watch.

## Purpose

SubCycle analyzes your taste preferences and upcoming content across streaming platforms to give you actionable recommendations: keep, pause, or consider each subscription. Stop paying for services with nothing you want to watch.

- [ ] Phase 12: Smart Notifications + Auto-Remind
- [ ] Phase 13a: Household Mode
- [ ] Phase 13b: Social/Friends
